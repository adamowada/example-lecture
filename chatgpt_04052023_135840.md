## Prompt:
Please design multiple, short, Python warm-up exercises that teach and focus on Big O analysis. Provide python code and ask students to analyze the Big O.

Start easy and then slowly increase difficulty. For now just respond with the questions and the code, I'll ask for solutions later. Your response will be copied and pasted verbatim so please drop conversation

## Response:

Exercise 1:
Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:

```python
def example1(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in arr:
        total += i
    return total
```

Exercise 2:
Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:

```python
def example2(arr):
    product = 1
    for i in arr:
        for j in arr:
            product *= i * j
    return product
```

Exercise 3:
Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:

```python
def example3(arr, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(arr[i])
    return result
```

Exercise 4:
Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:

```python
def example4(arr):
    max_value = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > max_value:
            max_value = arr[i]
    return max_value
```

Exercise 5:
Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:

```python
def example5(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr
```
