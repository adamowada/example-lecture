## Prompt:
Please design multiple, short, Python warm-up exercises that teach and focus on Big O analysis. Start easy and then slowly increase difficulty. For now just respond with the questions and the code, I'll ask for solutions later. Your response will be copied and pasted verbatim so please drop conversation

## Response:

Exercise 1:
Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer provided by the user. Analyze the time complexity of your function.

```python
def sum_numbers(n):
    # Your code here
```

Exercise 2:
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the squares of the input elements
