## Prompt:
Write python code that rolls 1 through 6 random dice

## Response:

Here is a simple Python code that rolls 1 to 6 random dice:

```scss
import random

def roll_dice():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

print("You rolled a", roll_dice())
```

This code uses the <code>random</code> module and its <code>randint</code> function to generate a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive, which represents the outcome of rolling a dice. The <code>roll_dice</code> function can be called multiple times to simulate rolling the dice multiple times.
